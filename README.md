# Game giveaways
This is a demo project to tryout `Compose Desktop`.

`Compose Desktop` is in its very early state, when I created this application. So, quick a bit of things will properly 
change over time, and I will not give any guarantee that I will keep this project up-to-date.

## Description
First of, I am using the [gamerpower api](https://www.gamerpower.com/api-read) to fetch the data that is used in this
project.

In the application, you will be provided with a list of games which are free giveaways! You can select a game on the list
and `loot` it to your collection of entertainment. If you are looking for something specific, it is also possible to filter
out the things which you are looking for.


## What does this project consist of
* Retrofit (For HTTP communication)
* Koin (Dependency injection)

NB! There is currently no real persistence in the application.
